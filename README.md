## Data

### all_solubilities.csv

This is a combined dataset of all the solubility data. It contains the following columns:

- `formula`: The chemical formula of the compound. Note that hydrates are listed as (H2O)$_n$.
- `reduced_formula`: The chemical formula of the compound, processed with pymatgen's *Composition.reduced_formula* method. For example, the reduced formula of "O6Fe4" is "Fe2O3".
- `solubility_XXC`: The solubility of the compound in water at XX degrees Celsius, in
  grams of solute per 100g H2O (i.e., 100 mL).

Data adapted from the raw data sources below.
